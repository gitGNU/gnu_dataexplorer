<P>The device dialog is used to configure the visualization of the displayed data.
Using the "import HoTT file" button a file selection dialog enable to open new files while applying the current visible
visualization configuration dialog.
Start/Stop live data gathering uses the configured serial port.
Selecting the Baud rate also selects the used protocol type.
115200 Baud for mx-12(#33112), mx-16(#33116), mx-20(#33124), mc-32(#33032), 19200 Baud for mx-12(#4754), mx-16(#4755), mc-19,22,24(#33300 module, #33301 module, #33302 module).
The 19200 Baud protocol has support for legacy, as well as new firmware. The new firmware package starts with Smart-Box version 4.0.

<P><B>Hint: </B>Curves will be switched invisible if they contain only zero as data points, even if selected! 
This might be corrected by re-selecting the curve in this configuration dialog.

<P><B>Tip: </B>Since the HoTTAdapter stores GPS data it is possible to load and display such data in Google Earth using KMZ files.
This files can be exported using the file menu or directly launched to an installed Google Earth application.
How to do so, refer to <A HREF="../../../help/en/HelpInfo_36.html">Toolbar -> Google Earth</A>.
Using HoTTAdapter2 all received measurement values are displayed at a single time scale. 
There are different configurations which result in different statistical analysis for possible measured motor run times and used up batteries capacity.
