<H3><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=3>Data export in KML or GPX file format</FONT></FONT></H3>
<P>Using the file menu, File -> Export, it is possible to export GPS based data, if available, in the Google Earth KML data format,
as well as the "global positioning system" (GPS) exchange format GPX.
</BR>
Both data formats can be opened and viewed using the Google Earth application.
Google Earth is not capable to make height information visible, therefore the export using the relative height is recommended.
The GPX format enables to select track points where height information as well as speed will be made visible.
Using a GPX file with relative height it is not required to select "Adapt height to ground", which would eliminate the visible height information of the track.
