How to setup eclipse workspace to build the DataExplorer

== Prepare your system ==
- Install the JDK
- Install Eclipse
- Install ant-contrib from http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
- Make sure that the ANT classpath (Window > Preferences > Ant > Runtime) is correct, containing...
  - all the jars from Eclipse�s org.apache.ant plugin directory
  - the tools.jar from the JDK�s lib directory
  - the ant-contrib jar
- Check that the file encoding is set to UTF-8 (Window > Preferences > General > Workspace)

== Setup DataExplorer in Eclipse ==
- Check out all projects via CVS (https://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=dataexplorer). Checking out only specific projects won't work, as the build files expect all projects to exist
- Next, configure the needed classpath variable:
  - Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables
    - Add "SWT_JAR_PATH" with the appropriate path to your system in "build/lib"
- Open the properties of the DataExplorer project
  - Enable project specific settings for "Clean Up" and "Formatter"
    - Import the settings from "build/setup" (code_cleanup_preferences.xml and code_format_preferences.xml)

== Prepare stuff ==
- In the "build" project, locate the file "build build.xml clean dist.launch"
  - Right-click on it and choose "Run as"
    - Select the first entry from the context menu to create all needed directories and files within

== Start the application within Eclipse ==
- In the DataExplorer project, locate the file "DataExplorer.launch", right-click on it and choose "Debug as > Java Application"
