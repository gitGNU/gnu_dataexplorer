OpenSerialDataExplorer is used to be build and installed using the GNU 
standard way calling 

	./configure && make && make install

Since SerialDataExplorer is a Java based program there are several 
tools required where Java based programs build and execution relies 
on

	Java SDK 	which is required to set JAVA_HOME and PATH to javac executable
	ant 		which is required to set ANT_HOME and PATH to ant executable

The default install directory according the prefix variable, which might
be different where the source gets build and make install is called.
To define the installation directory of your choice use 
	./configure --prefix=/opt && make install
this will install to the given directory which will be /opt/OpenSerialDataExplorer
for the given example.

First time startup requires usage of the start script in the
installation directory (Windows use the executable OpenSerialDataExplorer.exe)

Afterwards the application gives the capability to 
maintain desktop shortcuts as well as start menu
entries. 
During runtime a online help is available.
